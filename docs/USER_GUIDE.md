# BMMacintosh User Guide

BMMacintosh turns a Raspberry Pi into a 68k Macintosh: a Mac II or Quadra
(a 68040 with an FPU, System 7 to Mac OS 8.1) on a Pi 4 or 5, and a Mac
Plus on every Pi. It runs the emulators on the bare hardware, so it starts
in a couple of seconds and can be switched off at any time.

## The two Macs

| | Mac II and Quadra | Mac Plus |
|---|---|---|
| Emulator | Basilisk II (kanjitalk755's macemu) | umac (Matt Evans), with Musashi |
| Kernels | `macii8-rpi4.img`, `macii_2712.img` | `macplus.img`, `macplus7.img`, `macplus8-32.img`, `macplus8-rpi4.img`, `macplus_2712.img` |
| Pi | 4, 400, 5, 500, 500+ | every Pi |
| CPU | 68040 with an FPU (or a 68020 or 68030) | 68000, 7.83 MHz |
| Memory | 8 to 256 MB | 128K to 4 MB |
| Screen | 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768; black and white to millions of colours (the Monitors control panel) | 512x342, black and white |
| ROM | a IIci's or a Quadra's (best a Quadra 650's or 800's) | the Mac Plus's (its last) |
| Disks | hard disks, two floppy drives, a CD-ROM drive, and a folder on the card (*SD Card*) | one disk, a floppy's or a hard disk's |
| Settings | `macii.prefs` (Basilisk II's own) | `bmmac.cfg` |

Each is a kernel of its own (two 68k CPU cores in one program would
clash). The Pi's firmware starts the one `config.txt` names. **Machine** in
the menu switches: it changes the `kernel=` lines of `config.txt`'s `[pi4]`
and `[pi5]` sections and restarts the Pi. A Pi 4 or 5 starts as a Mac II
the first time; a Pi Zero, 2 or 3 is always a Mac Plus. Both Macs use the
same card: the ROMs, the disks, the web UI and BMMacintosh's settings.

## The SD card

| File or folder   | What it is                                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `macii*.img`, `macplus*.img` | The kernels (above)                            |
| `bootcode.bin`, `start.elf`, `fixup.dat`, `start4.elf`, `fixup4.dat`, `armstub8-rpi4.bin`, `*.dtb`, `overlays/` | Raspberry Pi firmware |
| `config.txt`     | Raspberry Pi firmware settings: the kernel each board starts, the display mode |
| `cmdline.txt`    | BMMacintosh's options (see Options)                         |
| `bmmac.cfg`      | Settings changed in BMMacintosh's menu, and the Mac Plus's (written by BMMacintosh) |
| `macii.prefs`    | The Mac II's settings, in Basilisk II's own format: the ROM, the disks, the memory, the screen (written by BMMacintosh) |
| `macii.xpram`    | The Mac II's parameter RAM (the Control Panel's settings) |
| `macplus.pram`   | The Mac Plus's: its clock chip's parameter RAM, and how far its clock was set from the Pi's |
| `roms/`          | Your Mac ROMs (see ROMs)                                    |
| `disks/`         | For your disk images (any folder works)                     |
| `shared/`        | A folder the Mac II sees as a disk, *SD Card*               |
| `firmware/`      | Wi-Fi firmware                                              |

The Macs read and write their disk images in place, and BMMacintosh pushes
everything out to the card every second, so the Pi can be switched off at
any time (give it a second or two after saving, once the disk light is
off).

## ROMs

Apple's ROMs aren't free, so none come with BMMacintosh. Put your own in
the card's `roms` folder: ROM files, or MAME's zipped ROM sets as they are
(MAME keeps some ROMs in their chips, two or four, and BMMacintosh puts
them back together). BMMacintosh tells ROMs by their contents, not their
names. [ROMS.txt](ROMS.txt) lists which ones each Mac takes. *ROM* in the
menu chooses between the ones found; without a ROM, the Mac says what's
missing (and F12 still opens the menu, to switch Macs).

## Disks

The Mac starts from a disk with a System folder; without one it shows a
flashing "?" disk. System software isn't free either: use your own disk
images. MAME's hard disks (CHD files) need making raw first: see
[ROMS.txt](ROMS.txt).

**Mac II.** *Hard Disks* in the menu adds hard disk images (raw, or with an
Apple partition map, up to 4 GB): the Mac starts from the first. They
change when the Mac restarts (*Restart the Mac*). *Insert a Floppy Disk*
puts a floppy image (400K, 800K, 1.4 MB, raw or DiskCopy 4.2) in one of
the two floppy drives while the Mac runs, *Insert a CD-ROM* an `.iso` or
`.toast` image in the CD-ROM drive; the Mac ejects them (Command-E, or
dragging them to the Trash). *Shared Folder* makes the card's `shared`
folder a disk on the Mac's desktop, *SD Card*: files copied into it (from
a PC, or the web UI) are the Mac's, and the other way round. The Mac's
files keep their type and creator, and their resource forks, in `.finf`
and `.rsrc` folders next to them; characters FAT can't have in a name are
written `%XX` on the card.

**Mac Plus.** *Disk* in the menu chooses its disk (a floppy image, raw or
DiskCopy 4.2, or a hard disk's HFS volume), and the Mac starts again from
it. A DiskCopy image's checksum is kept right as the Mac writes to it. *No Disk*
takes it out. When the Mac ejects its disk the drive stays empty until
the Mac restarts.

**Extensions.** Hold Shift while Mac OS starts to start it without its
extensions, as on a real Mac: the way past an extension that stops it.
Mac OS 8.1 from MAME's `macos81.chd`, for one, stops at its A/ROSE
extension otherwise.

## The menu

**F12** (or a gamepad's Home, or Select and Start together) opens the menu,
and the Mac stops while it's open. The arrow keys (or the D-pad) move,
**Enter** (or A) chooses, **Esc** (or B) goes back, and F12 again closes it.

| Item          | What it has |
|---------------|-------------|
| Insert a Floppy Disk, Insert a CD-ROM | Mac II: a disk into an empty drive |
| Hard Disks    | Mac II: adding and removing hard disk images |
| Shared Folder | Mac II: the card's `shared` folder as a disk |
| Disk, No Disk | Mac Plus: its disk |
| ROM           | The ROMs found that this Mac takes |
| Memory        | The Mac's memory (it restarts) |
| Restart the Mac | Switching the Mac off and on |
| Machine       | The Mac Plus or the Mac II (the Pi restarts) |
| Video         | Screen size, frame lock, CRT effect, smooth scaling, disk activity |
| Sound         | Volume, HDMI or the headphone jack |
| Network       | Ethernet or Wi-Fi, the web UI |
| About         | Versions, the machine, the display |

The menu's last line shows how often frames are shown, as a percentage of
the Mac's 60.15 a second. The Mac II runs as many instructions in a frame
as the Pi manages; the Mac Plus runs at about a real Plus's speed, and
under 100% the Pi can't keep up.

## Keyboard and mouse

Keys go to the Mac by what they are. The keys around the space bar are
where a Mac's are:

| PC key                   | Mac key         |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Alt (either)             | Command         |
| Windows key              | Option          |
| Ctrl                     | Control (Mac II)|
| Backspace                | Delete          |
| Delete                   | Forward delete (Mac II) |
| F11, Insert              | Help (Mac II)   |
| Num Lock                 | Clear           |
| Print Screen, Scroll Lock, Pause | F13, F14, F15 (Mac II) |

Caps Lock locks, as the Mac's does. F12 is BMMacintosh's menu. The power
key (a Pi 400's Fn+F10) shuts down.

The Mac Plus's keyboard is the Plus's: the main keys, the arrow keys and
the keypad (its + * / = come with Shift, as on the Plus's own keyboard),
no Control or Escape. Keys go to it one at a time, every other frame, from
a queue.

A USB mouse is the Mac's mouse (the left button; the Mac has one). A
gamepad moves the mouse too: the left stick or D-pad moves the pointer,
A clicks, X types Space and Y Return.

## Display and timing

The Mac shows 60.15 frames a second. When the display's refresh rate is
within 2% of that, each frame is shown on exactly one display refresh;
otherwise the emulation keeps exact time. `config.txt` sets the display
to 720p at 60 Hz, and on a Pi 4 or 5 BMMacintosh sets it to the Mac's
exact rate itself (see [PI4.md](PI4.md)). `vsync=on` or `vsync=off` in
`cmdline.txt` (or *Frame Lock* in the menu) forces one or the other.

A small red light at the bottom right of the Mac's screen shows the disk
in use (*Video*, *Show Disk Activity*).

## Networking and the web UI

BMMacintosh can join your network over Ethernet or Wi-Fi and serve a web page
for managing the SD card from any browser on the same network, so files can
be copied to and from the Pi without taking the card out. It is the web UI
from BMC64.

Turn it on in the menu's *Network*. For Ethernet, set *Network* to Ethernet
and reboot. For Wi-Fi, choose *Scan for Wi-Fi Networks*: the first time,
it offers to switch Wi-Fi on and reboot; after that it lists the networks
it can hear, strongest first. Pick yours: it fills in *Wi-Fi Network*, and
if the network needs a password, *Wi-Fi Password* is next. Then reboot.
Set *Wi-Fi Country* to your two letter country code too; it decides which
channels are allowed. A hidden network can be typed in under *Wi-Fi
Network* instead. Or, in `cmdline.txt` (on the same single line as the
other options):

- Ethernet: `network=ethernet`
- Wi-Fi: `network=wifi`, and copy `wpa_supplicant.conf.example` to
  `wpa_supplicant.conf` in the root of the card with your network's name,
  password and country.

Wi-Fi needs the files in the `firmware` folder, which `build_sdcard.sh` puts
there.

Once the Pi has an address, it is shown at the bottom of the screen for a
few seconds (`WEB UI: HTTP://192.168.1.50/`) and written to the log.
Open that address in a browser.

The web UI has:

- **Dashboard**: the Pi's model, address, uptime, temperature, power and
  throttling warnings and free space on the card. Buttons to **Restart**
  the Mac (as switching it off and on), **Reboot** BMMacintosh, **Shut
  Down** (the Pi halts; switch it off, then on again to restart; a Pi 400
  switches itself off, and its power key starts it again), and **Disable
  Web UI** until the next reboot.
- **Files**: browse the SD card; upload (or drag and drop) files into a
  folder, download, rename, delete, and create folders. Clicking a disk
  image **starts it**: the Mac starts again from it (on the Mac II a
  floppy image goes in the floppy drive, a CD-ROM image in the CD-ROM
  drive, a hard disk image becomes the first hard disk). `cmdline.txt`,
  `config.txt`, `bmmac.cfg`, `macii.prefs` and `wpa_supplicant.conf` can
  be **edited**
  in the browser; changes take effect after a reboot, and the previous
  version is kept as `.bak`.

Uploads can't overwrite `cmdline.txt`, `config.txt` or `wpa_supplicant.conf`
(edit them instead), or anything in `firmware`. Everything else, including
the kernels, can be replaced, so a new build of BMMacintosh can be uploaded and
started with **Reboot**. A mistake in `cmdline.txt` or `config.txt` can stop
the Pi starting, and then needs the card in a computer (the `.bak` copy
makes that easy).

The web UI is open to anyone on your network. To protect it with a PIN, set
`webui_pin=1234` in `cmdline.txt`; the browser then asks for a user name
(anything) and the PIN. To network without the web UI, set `webui=0`.

### The Mac II on the network

With the Pi on the network, the Mac II is too: its Ethernet card is
connected to a small network of its own inside BMMacintosh (slirp, as in
Basilisk II and QEMU), which reaches the internet through the Pi's
connection, Ethernet or Wi-Fi. In Mac OS, open the *TCP/IP* control panel,
connect via *Ethernet*, configure *Using DHCP Server*, and close it to
save: the Mac gets the address 10.0.2.15, with 10.0.2.2 its router and
10.0.2.3 its DNS server (which asks the Pi's). Open Transport loads TCP/IP
only when a program asks for it; to have it at once, *Edit*, *User Mode*,
*Advanced*, then *Options* and untick *Load only when needed*.

The Mac's programs can then connect out (web browsers, FTP, mail, news):
their connections leave from the Pi's address. Nothing on your network
can connect to the Mac, there's no AppleTalk (so no file sharing or
printing to other Macs), and ping doesn't get past the Pi. Old browsers
can't open most of today's web sites, which need newer encryption than
they have.

The Mac starts with the network up (the log says "the Mac's network is
up" once the Pi has its address). To leave it off, add `nonet true` to
`macii.prefs`. The Mac Plus has no network.

The network also sets the Pi's clock, so files saved on the card get the
right date and time. Set `timezone` to your offset from UTC in minutes, for
example `timezone=600` for UTC+10. Both Macs' clocks are the Pi's, in that
time zone; setting the Mac's clock (the Control Panel, the Alarm Clock)
moves it from there, and the Mac Plus keeps that in `macplus.pram`.

## Options

`cmdline.txt` is a single line of `name=value` options separated by spaces.
BMMacintosh's menu saves the options it changes to `bmmac.cfg`, one
`name=value` per line, and those win over `cmdline.txt`. Either file can be
edited from the web UI. The Mac II's own settings are in `macii.prefs`,
which the menu changes.

| Option              | Values                       | Default  | What it does |
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------|--------------|
| `aspect`            | number                       | `1.0`    | Multiplies the width of the picture |
| `disk_activity`     | `0`, `1`                     | `1`      | The disk light (Video, Show Disk Activity) |
| `scale`             | 0.1 to 1.0                   | `1.0`    | Height of the picture as a fraction of the screen (Video, Screen Size; less for a TV that cuts off the edges) |
| `smooth`            | `0`, `1`                     | `0`      | Bilinear filtering instead of sharp pixels |
| `crt_shader`        | `0`, `1`                     | `0`      | CRT look (scanlines) from BMC64 |
| `crt_curvature`     | `0`, `1`                     | `0`      | With `crt_shader`, a curved screen |
| `crt_gpu`           | `0`, `1`                     | `1`      | Pi 4 and 5: the 3D GPU draws the smooth and CRT pictures; `0` has the ARM draw them (see [PI4.md](PI4.md)) |
| `vsync`             | `auto`, `on`, `off`          | `auto`   | Lock frames to the display (see Display and timing) |
| `resolution`        | `auto`, `1920x1080`, `1280x720` | `auto` | Pi 5 only, with `video_driver=kms`: the display's resolution; `auto` keeps the one the firmware chose (the Pi 5's firmware ignores `hdmi_mode`) |
| `video_driver`      | `kms`, `hvs`, `firmware`     | `kms`    | Pi 4 and 5: `kms` runs the display at the Mac's exact frame rate; `hvs` leaves the mode set in `config.txt`; `firmware` uses the firmware's framebuffer, if the others give trouble (see [PI4.md](PI4.md) and [PI5.md](PI5.md)) |
| `sound`             | `0`, `1`                     | `1`      | Sound on or off |
| `volume`            | 0 to 100                     | `100`    | Sound volume |
| `audio_out`         | `auto`, `hdmi`, `headphones` | `auto`   | Where the sound goes (`auto`: HDMI, or the headphone jack if the display takes no sound) |
| `audio_buffer_ms`   | 20 to 500                    | `60`     | Sound buffer; raise it if the sound breaks up |
| `plus_rom`, `plus_disk`, `plus_ram` | a path; KB (128 to 4096) | | The Mac Plus's ROM, disk and memory (the menu sets them) |
| `ii_max_instructions` | number                     | `2000000` | The most instructions the Mac II runs in a frame |
| `enable_logging`    | `off`, `uart`, `file`        | `off`    | Where the log goes (see Logging) |
| `network`           | `off`, `ethernet`, `wifi`    | `off`    | Networking (see Networking and the web UI) |
| `webui`             | `0`, `1`                     | `1`      | Web UI when networking is on |
| `webui_pin`         | digits                       | none     | PIN for the web UI |
| `timezone`          | minutes east of UTC          | `0`      | Time zone for the network clock |
| `usbpowerdelay`     | milliseconds                 | Circle's | Circle: wait for USB devices to power up (by default 300 ms, 510 ms behind a hub) |

## Logging

BMMacintosh logs what it is doing, which helps when something doesn't work:
the version, the display and sound set up, the ROMs found and the one
used, the disk images opened, devices coming and going, network status,
and the emulators' own messages. Choose
where it goes with `enable_logging` in `cmdline.txt`:

- **Off** (the default, also when `enable_logging` isn't set): no log.
- **UART**: the serial port, GPIO14 TX and GPIO15 RX at 115200 baud
  (all boards, the Pi 5 too). Needs a USB serial adapter.
- **File**: the serial port, and `bmmac.log` in the root of the SD
  card. The file starts with what was logged since boot, is written to the
  card every few seconds (and is complete after a crash, a hang or
  switching off), and starts again at boot once it is over 1 MB. Download
  it from the web UI's file manager to send with a bug report. Writing it
  costs a little time on each frame, so switch it off once you have what
  you need.

## Troubleshooting

**"No Mac II or Quadra ROM" or "No Mac Plus ROM"**: put a ROM that Mac
takes in the card's `roms` folder ([ROMS.txt](ROMS.txt)), or switch Macs
(F12, Machine).

**The flashing "?" disk**: the Mac has no disk it can start from. Choose
one in the menu (Hard Disks or Disk) and *Restart the Mac*. A Mac II hard
disk from MAME needs making raw first, and the Mac Plus takes an HFS
volume, not a whole hard disk with its partition map ([ROMS.txt](ROMS.txt)).

**"Sorry, a system error occurred" while Mac OS starts**: often an
extension: hold Shift while it starts.

**No picture**: uncomment `hdmi_safe=1` in `config.txt`. If that works, your
display doesn't accept 720p at 60 Hz; try another `hdmi_mode`.

**No sound over HDMI**: try `hdmi_drive=2` in `config.txt`, or
`audio_out=hdmi` in `cmdline.txt`.

**Sound breaks up**: raise `audio_buffer_ms` in `cmdline.txt`, e.g. to 100.

**The TV cuts off the top and bottom of the picture or the menu**: many TVs
enlarge the picture and crop its edges (overscan). Make *Video*, *Screen
Size* smaller (90% usually does), or turn overscan off on the TV ("Just
Scan", "Screen Fit" or "1:1").

**Keyboard, mouse or gamepad not working**: unplug it and plug it in again;
devices can come and go while the emulator runs. Some keyboards need a
longer `usbpowerdelay` (add `usbpowerdelay=1000` to `cmdline.txt`).

**8BitDo M30 2.4G buttons are wrong**: its receiver can be left in Switch
mode, where it acts as a Switch Pro controller. With the pad connected,
hold Home (the heart) and D-pad Down for 5 seconds until the LEDs flash; it
goes back to its own mode and keeps it.
